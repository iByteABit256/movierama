# 🎬 Movierama

Movierama is a social movie sharing platform where users can share their favorite movies, like or hate movies, and explore submissions from other users.

---

## 🏗 Project Overview

- Users can **sign up** or **log in**.
- Registered users can **add movies** with a title, description, and date.
- Users can **vote** (like or hate) on movies submitted by others.  
  - Votes are limited to one per movie per user.  
  - Users can change or retract their votes.
  - Users **cannot vote** for movies they submitted.
- Movie listings display:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Name of the submitting user (clickable to filter by user)
  - Date of publication
  - Number of likes
  - Number of hates
- Movies can be **sorted** by likes, hates, or publication date.

## 🏠 Running Movierama

Movierama is fully containerized with Docker. The backend, frontend, and database run in separate containers on a shared network.

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose 

---

### Start the Application

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Stop the Application

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Open in Browser

After starting, open http://localhost:5173.

## ⚡ Performance Comparison — Rust vs. Spring Boot

As part of the migration from the original **Spring Boot (Java)** backend to the new **Rust (Axum)** backend, I did load tests using [Grafana k6](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/).

The tests simulated a consistent load of **50 requests per second** over a fixed duration, measuring response latency and throughput for both implementations.

| Metric                          |   Rust (Axum) | Spring Boot (Java) | Notes                                       |
| :------------------------------ | ------------: | -----------------: | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Average latency (avg)**       |  **≈ 2.7 ms** |          ≈ 17.7 ms | Rust handled requests ~6× faster on average |
| **90th percentile (p90)**       |  **≈ 3.9 ms** |          ≈ 15.5 ms | 90% of Rust responses completed under 4 ms  |
| **99th percentile (p99)**       | **≈ 12.5 ms** |           ≈ 276 ms | Spring showed occasional long GC pauses     |
| **Requests per second (req/s)** |      50 req/s |           50 req/s | Identical test load for both                |

### 🧩 Interpretation

* **Rust (Axum)** delivers consistently low latency and minimal variance.
* **Spring Boot** shows higher average latency and long-tail spikes due to JVM garbage collection and heavier threading.
* **Overall**, the Rust backend is **significantly faster, leaner, and more predictable**, making it ideal for real-time APIs or resource-constrained deployments.

### 📊 Visualization

The figure below summarizes the results generated by the k6 + Python visualization pipeline:

The chart plots **average**, **p90**, and **p99** latencies for both backends side-by-side, clearly showing Rust’s tighter performance distribution.
